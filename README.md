# image_classify_george
Project Overview

This project involves training an image classification model to detect the presence of St. George in images. We use a pre-trained EfficientNet-B0 model fine-tuned for this binary classification task.
Data

    Dataset Source: The images are obtained from two CSV files: georges.csv (containing images with St. George) and non_georges.csv (containing images without St. George).
    Data Download: If additional data is required for improving model performance, we suggest downloading additional image datasets from sources like ImageNet, CIFAR-10, or similar image repositories. For this project, however, the provided dataset is used.
